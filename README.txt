I. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------

Welcome to the world of POLARITY...

This is a DEMO VERSION developed for COMPSCI 4483B - Game Design at Western University, Winter 2017.

Included in this demo are the core features of Polarity: four separate stages showcasing up to four layers of reality for the player to experience. Associated with each successive layer of reality are INSIGHTS - mechanics that change the way the player is able to interact with the game world.


--------------------------------
II. CONTROLS
--------------------------------

ARROW KEYS			- Movement
E (on bubble)			- Descend into the next layer
UP ARROW			- Jump

UP ARROW + UP ARROW		- Double Jump (Layer 2 and below)

RIGHT / LEFT ARROW (into wall)	- Wall Cling (Layer 3 and below)
UP ARROW (in wall cling)	- Jump from Wall Cling (Layer 3 and below)

HOLD UP ARROW			- Glide (Layer 4 only)


POLARITY controls with the use of the ARROW KEYS, allowing for omnidirectional movement. The player can also interact with the bubbles, and swap layers, using the E key. 

Once the double jump is unlocked in layer two, a second press of the UP ARROW will allow for a second jump midair. Holding the LEFT or RIGHT ARROW KEY towards a vertical surface in the third layer will allow the player to cling to the wall.

On the fourth layer, the player's weight will change upon holding the UP ARROW, allowing the player to glide briefly.

III. STORY OUTLINE
--------------------------------

YOU, the player, control an everyman on his journey. 

What begins as a simple stroll along the Old Road to the estate of your estranged grandfather quickly results in a descent into the madness that lurks just below our fragile surface world.

Entering the tenebrous keep, your everyman learns to access new layers of reality, utilizing the frail BUBBLES -- access points that reveal INSIGHTS about the world, at the cost of revealing a little more of what lurks just in the corner of your eye...

Helpless, defenseless, and utterly alone. Will you be able to withstand the horrors that exist just beyond our reach?
